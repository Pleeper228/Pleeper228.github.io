          I started programming in college as a hobby. I love video games and at some point decided that I wanted to try making my own, so I downloaded Unity, found a 3DBuzz tutorial on how to build your first top-down space shooter, and the rest is history. Currently I'm enrolled in a Web Development Immersive program through Galvanize Inc. in Denver, CO, learning everything I can about programming and development!

          I like to be challenged both in life and at work, I enjoy working through problems and using my brains over my *cough* braun, and so far I've found that coding is a perfect fit for that! I also like working in environments where I feel like my ideas matter, where I am respected, and where people are what is most important always.

          When I have time on my hands I love traveling through Europe as much as I love traveling through Lodran, I'm fond of recording music projects in my home studio anything from folk styles to 8-bit, and I absolutely freak out over good food, as far as I'm concerned nothing beats a perfect meal.
