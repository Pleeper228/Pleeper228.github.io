              I'm a full-stack developer and former musician with a BS in Recording Arts Technology that helps me approach problems with new, creative solutions. Working as a Live Sound Engineer I've learned to adapt quickly, if problems occur during an event you can't just stop, the show must go on, and that's the same attitude I bring to web development.
